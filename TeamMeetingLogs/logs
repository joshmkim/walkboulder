  Decisions Made:
    - Confirmation on our project idea
    - A general idea of who would / want to do certain tasks

  Alternative Options
    - Scope of focus: 
        -> walking and trails 
        -> busses and bikes
        -> within the city or trails 
    - Finding / using different APIs

  Follow-Up
    - Implementation for some of the databases: badge use, users, login/logout
    - More investigations into various APIs to see if they match our desired outcome
    - Design and finish the database outline
